# Serverless GraphQL TypeScript Starter ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)

This is a basic TypeScript boilerplate to kitstart your Serverless GraphQL projects with AWS Lambda. 

It is powered by [`Apollo-Server-Lambda`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server-lambda) and uses the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/) to deploy it to AWS.

This is hugely inspired by the starter that [Anomaly Innovations](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-nodejs-starter ) created. The project was cloned from it. 

## Prerequistes 

* [An AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
* [A configured AWS CLI](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/)
* [Serverless Framework installed on your machine](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/)
* [NodeJS](nodejs.org) 

Note this project uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com). 

This project is still a work in progress!
